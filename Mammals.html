    <h4> <p style="color:white"> There are 13 different species of otters which are a part of the mustelidae family. Otters are semiaquatic carnivorous mammals that typically live in cold areas. Otters have extremely high metabolic rates in order to keep themselves warm and must eat 20-25% of their body weight each day to survive depending on the species. Otters are extremely playful animals that engage in various types of different activities and behaviours for their own sheer enjoyment. </p> </h4>
