 <h3> <p style="color:white"> The Venus flyrap is one of the only carnivorous plants and is located in the subtropical wetlands in the United States. The plant is built with a trapping structure that functions in order to bait and constrict its food. The plant is trigger when one-tenth of an insect is within the contact range. Sadly, the Venus flytrap has been labeled as an endangered species and thus placed under the Endangered Species Act. </p> </h3>

    <h3> <p style="color:white"> Baobab trees are seen throughout Africa, Madagascar, India, Ceylon, and Australia. They are most commonly seen in area of Zimbabwe and are said to have supersticious properties. For example, if you pick a flower from a Baobab tree it is believe that you will be eaten by a lion, but if you drink the water from Baobab seeds you will be protected from a crocodile attack. Baobab trees range from 5-20 meters in height and the trunk is large enough to fit upwards of 40 people inside of it. Baobabs have functioned as prisons, houses, shops, storage barns, and bus shelters. The bark of a baobab is very smooth and shiny and unlike most other trees has a grey copper coloring to it. </p> </h3>
